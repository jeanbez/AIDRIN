## [Unreleased]

### Changed (breaking)

- **Completeness — `Overall Completeness` is now column-wise.** The
  `completeness` metric's `Overall Completeness` value changed from a *row-wise*
  score (the fraction of rows with no missing value in any column) to a
  *column-wise* score (the mean of the per-column non-missing rates, equivalently
  `1 - df.isnull().mean().mean()`).

  **Why:** the row-wise definition counted a row as incomplete if *any* single
  cell was missing, so the score collapsed toward `0` on wide datasets even when
  every column was individually near-complete — misleading for the per-column
  scores the metric reports. The column-wise definition is the mean of those
  per-column scores and degrades gracefully.

  **Impact:** any consumer reading `result["Overall Completeness"]` will see a
  different (generally higher) number when missing values are scattered across
  columns. The two are equal only when the dataset is fully complete or when
  every missing cell falls in the same rows.

  Example — two columns each 50% complete, missing in *different* rows:
  - before (row-wise): `0.0`
  - after (column-wise): `0.5`

  The interim keys `Overall Completeness (row-wise)` and
  `Overall Completeness (column-wise)` (present briefly on this branch) were
  removed in favor of the single `Overall Completeness` key.

### Added

- **New timeliness metrics** (CLI, Python library, batch, MCP, Globus, and web
  UI), under Data Quality, with a shared multi-format datetime parser
  (`aidrin/file_handling/datetime_utils.py`) that accepts native datetime, Unix
  epochs (s/ms/us auto-detected), and date strings (ISO + common + mixed),
  normalizing to tz-naive UTC and reporting unparsable-value counts:
  - `data_freshness` — age of the newest record versus a required as-of
    `reference_time` (params: `timestamp_column`, `reference_time`). Reports the
    headline age, an age distribution, and the reference used (for reproducibility).
  - `data_latency` — per-record delay between two timestamps (params:
    `event_column`, `availability_column`). Reports mean/median/p95/max seconds
    and a negative-latency (clock-skew) count.

- **New data-quality completeness metrics** (CLI, Python library, batch, MCP,
  Globus, and web UI):
  - `row_level_completeness` — % of rows whose *required* columns are all
    non-null (param: `required_columns`).
  - `feature_coverage_ratio` — % of features whose non-null rate meets a
    threshold (param: `threshold`, default `0.9`).
  - `temporal_completeness` — % of expected time intervals present (params:
    `timestamp_column`, `frequency` default `"D"`). Computes present/expected
    counts arithmetically (grid-flooring for fixed offsets, period bucketing for
    anchored offsets like `W`/`ME`/`QE`/`YE`) rather than materializing the full
    interval set — correct for anchored frequencies and safe for fine ones
    (`s`/`ms`/… no longer hang on long spans).
  - `null_count_trend` — null counts grouped by a batch column, to spot quality
    regressions (params: `batch_column`, optional `target_columns`).
